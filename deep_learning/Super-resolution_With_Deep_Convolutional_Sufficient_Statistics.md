# SUPER-RESOLUTION WITH DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL SUFFICIENT STATISTICS

It is also an inverse problem from low resolution picture to high resolution picture. The ability to model complex geometrical structures and textured regions. Interestingly enough, they use the Gibbs distribution. The features are stable to local deformation, and have reduced variance. Also, very interestingly, they say that they initialize the filters by multiscale complex wavelets, and propose the algorithm to fine-tune. This inverse problem is what stated by the Professor in the class. It is a recovery problem, and the formula is just like what is in image processing. Data is to adjust the prior distribution. They also want to capture the high frequency term.

Thoughout the reading, I do not get the rough idea?
