# SEMI-SUPERVISED KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FOR DEEP LEARNING FROM PRIVATE TRAINING DATA

Some information is really sensitive, skillful people can get more information from the machine. Here, the paper advocates the Algorithm of PATE. The term "Differential Privacy" is widely heard. The privacy is different, and must take care of the worst cases. PATE only reveals topmost vote after carefully adding the noise. Semi-supervised methods can extract distribution priors. 

Their approaches: 

-   partition data into n parts
-   Aggregation of the result

It trains with GAN, which greatly improves semi-supervised learning, especially trained with feature matching loss. Differential privacy is done using adjacent databases and only one differs by one training examples. The most contribution of this paper is that it establish a precise guarantee of training data privacy. We look forward to the RNN.
