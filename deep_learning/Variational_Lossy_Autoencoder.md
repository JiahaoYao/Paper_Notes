# VARIATIONAL LOSSY AUTOENCODER

A good representation might be able to describe the global structure and discard the detailed structure. The architecture wants to learn a lossy representation. This model can be viewed as improvement to the VAE, control representation learning and improve density estimation. There are some amazingly trickly mathematical formula, but it is not that difficult. What I doubt is whether I really understand. Again, the Blog [^ Blog] shows that an autoregressive model is some kind of stochastic process where he output depends linearly on the previous term. Also, the **optimization objective of VAE** is unknown to me. I think the formula in the blog is fake.(more specifically, the second equality.) 

Really want someone can implement such a thing, then can I understand.
