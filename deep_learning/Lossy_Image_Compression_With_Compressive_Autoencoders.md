# LOSSY IMAGE COMPRESSION WITH COMPRESSIVE AUTOENCODERS

The paper gives a new approach to the problem of autoencoders for lossy image compression. The model is computationally-efficient and high-resolution images. Lossy compression is inherently a non-differentiable problem. The framework is a encoder , a decoder and a probabilistic model Q. The discrete probability is an entropy model. The tradition autoencoder optimize the distortion term, meaning the distortion introduced by coding and encoding. The problem here is the function Q and Gaussian function is not differentiable. Also, this reminds me that in variational autoencoder, the conditional probability is respectfully an encoder and decoder. The architecure of the autoencoder in this paper combine the idea of resnet.
