# Machine Learning as an Adversarial Service: Learning Black-Box Adversarial Examples

The loss of the model cosists of two parts, adversarial loss and reconstruction loss. It gaurantees the model to be different and similar. The idea is minimize the distance between the source and adversarial image while causing a misclassification in the target model.

In the paper, it gives us the idea of how to attack and defense.
