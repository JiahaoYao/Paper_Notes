This contains my notes for research papers that I've read. Papers are arranged
according to three broad categories and then further numbered on a (1) to (5)
scale where a (1) means I have only barely skimmed it, while a (5) means I feel
confident that I understand almost everything about the paper. Within a single
year, these papers should be organized according to publication date.  The links
here go to my paper summaries if I have them, otherwise those papers are on my
**TODO** list.
