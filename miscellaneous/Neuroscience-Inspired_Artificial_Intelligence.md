# Neuroscience-Inspired Artificial Intelligence

The head of Deepmind publish a paper about AI and Neuron science in their blog [^Blog]. It seems urgent for AI and neuroscience to come together. AI technique just wants to mimic the action of brain.AI seems to get rid of algorithm and math, and get insight from neuroscience. A new term is biological computation. Recent, "replay" seems t work efficiently from neuroscience, by means of storing past experience and learning something new. I also understand "Imagination" is important, that is where our fanciest things start. Transfer learning is great or not? Exchange of knowledge is not a one-way street. AI and neuroscience can benefit together, creating a virtuous circle. Beautiful world, and we try to understand ourselves.

Communication and collaboration between Ai ann neuroscience is urgent. We are not slavish. From an engineering perspective, what works is ultimately all that matters. Neuroscience is a guide, not a requirement. And DNC [^DNC] and Learn-to-Learn [^LTL] also already on the fly. 

Come on, DeepMind !
